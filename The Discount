Question-Mrs.Raja is a miser to the core.She saves money even on petite things. One dayshe heard a discount offer announced in a shop. she wants to purchase lot of items to save her money. The discount is given only when atleast two items are bought. Since each item has different discount prices , she finds difficult to check the amount she has saved. So she approaches you to device a automated discount calculator to make her easy while billing. 
Coding-
#include<iostream>
#include<stdio.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   float item1,item2,d,a,b,c;
   cin>>item1>>item2>>d;
   a=item1+item2;
   b=(a*d)/100;                         
   c=a-b;
   printf("\n %.2f",a);
   printf("\n %.2f",c);
   printf("\n %.2f",b);
   return 0;
}
