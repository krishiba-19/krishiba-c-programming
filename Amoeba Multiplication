Question-
The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
Coding-
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int m,n3;
    int n1=0;
    int n2=1;
    cout<<"Enter the number of Months :"<<endl;
    cin>>m;
    if(m<13)
   {
       for(int i=1;i<=m-2;i++)
       {
           n3=n2+n1;
           n1=n2;
           n2=n3;
       }
       cout<<" The amoeba size is "<<n3;
   }
   else
   {
       cout<<"Invalid Input";
   }
}
